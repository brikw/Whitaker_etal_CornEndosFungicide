This repository includes the R code, data files, and small scriptsto supplement the manuscript by Whitaker et al. "Foliar fungicide application alters the culturable foliar fungal endophyte community in corn".

The field experiment was conducted at two locations in Illinois with either a broad spectrum foliar fungicide or a control. 

The three files ("CornDebrisFungicides_ExperimentalDesign-Plots.csv", “CornDebrisFungicides_ExperimentalDesign-CultureSamples.csv”, & "CornDebrisFungicides_ExperimentalDesign-Isolates-2023-06-27.csv") contain collected data and treatments information and collected data on experimental field plots, corn samples, and fungi isolated from corn leaves (respectively). 

The main statistical scripts are housed in the Rmd file "CDF_endophytes_v3.Rmd", while the other scripts (itsx.sh, CDF_OTU97_ITSx.R, & rdp_commandLine.txt) were used to process fasta sequences for ITSx and RDP taxonomic assignment. 

Please see the manuscript for details and full reference information.
